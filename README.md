I learned a lot of new things in this project. First of all, I understood how APIs work. I had dealt with apis a few times before, but I was constantly getting an error that I did not understand and the data I wanted was not coming. in this project i realized it was because i didn't add error message.

# What did I do in this project?

- I added tailwindcss and worked on it a bit.
- I have a better understanding of component structures.
- I understand how props work.
- I replaced the data from the API with other data.
- I used switch for the first time in a project. and it was very enjoyable :)

##  Wll add later.

- [ ] city search feature
- [ ] better have some effect.
